# Gamified-Learning
This project is basically a quiz where a student has to answer all the questions and the student's knowledge level of a particular subject is assessed.
The result is sent to the professor of the particular subject for analysis.
I have used Microsoft Visual Studio and SQL Server as the tools and used C# as the language.

To run the application download the code zip file,unzip it and add the database to SQL server.
Next,run the application on any web browser(preferably Google Chrome).
